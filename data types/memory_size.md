```
int myInt;
float myFloat;
double myDouble;
char myChar;

printf("%zu\n", sizeof(myInt));
printf("%zu\n", sizeof(myFloat));
printf("%zu\n", sizeof(myDouble));
printf("%zu\n", sizeof(myChar));
```
Note that we use the %zu format specifier to print the result, instead of %d. 
This is because the compiler expects the sizeof operator to return a value of type size_t, which is an unsigned integer type. 
On some computers it might work with %d, but it is safer and more portable to use %zu, which is specifically designed for printing size_t values.
